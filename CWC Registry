# The Clarity Weakness Classification Registry

In an attempt to tailor the excellent SWC Registry security vulnerabilty classification standard[1] to the Stacks blockchain and Clarity programming language, the Stacks Foundation has developed the CWC Registry. The CWC Registry is an attempt to categorize any and all weaknesses involving Stacks or Clarity into a single comprehensive reference document. This allows for faster triaging and analysis, an up-to-date resource for remediation, a standardized language for discussing vulnerabilities, and a way to track and protect against attack trends.

## The Classification

| | Validation issues and error handling | 
| | General logic flaws |
| Chain Splits & Reorgs | Accepting blocks under flawed conditions |
| | Creation of a new chain |
